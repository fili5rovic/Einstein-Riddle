# Einstein's Riddle

## Description
Einstein's Riddle involves solving a puzzle by assigning attributes to different categories using a specific set of rules. The solution to the puzzle is obtained through the implementation of various functions and algorithms.

> This project was developed as the second university assignment for "Algorithms and Data Structures", University of Belgrade School of Electrical Engineering, majoring Software Engineering. Please refer to the [instructions.pdf](instructions.pdf) file provided for detailed instructions regarding the assignment.

>I really enjoyed working on this project because it gave me a chance to explore different ways of navigating through trees using code. My assignment was all about implementing the pre-order tree traversal, and it turned out to be a great learning experience that helped me grasp this important concept in a practical way.



## Features
The project includes the following features:

- Interactive Menu: The project offers an interactive menu that allows users to play the puzzle, display the solution tree, check the correctness of their solutions, and receive hints.

- Puzzle Solving Algorithm: The core of the project lies in the puzzle-solving algorithm implemented in the `main.py` file. This algorithm manages the assignment of attributes to categories while adhering to predefined rules.

- Solution Tree Visualization: The project generates and displays a solution tree that illustrates the different possible combinations of attributes and categories. The solution tree is saved in the `stablo.txt` file.

- Attribute Manipulation: Users can interactively add attributes to categories using the format "category + attribute". The algorithm validates and updates the assignments accordingly.

- Correctness Check: The algorithm checks the correctness of user assignments and provides feedback on whether the solutions are accurate.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following main components:

- `main.py`: This file contains the core implementation of the puzzle-solving algorithm. It includes functions for adding, removing, and manipulating attributes within categories.

- `stablo.txt`: This file stores the output of the puzzle-solving algorithm, showcasing the tree structure and possible solutions.
